# Individually Addressable LED Project

This repository was made to hold of the programs that control the LEDs in my living room.

By communicating with my Raspberry Pi Zero via a browser-based GUI or directly through ssh, I am able to produce different patterns on my LED strip.


TODO:
*** When transferring to Pi ***
* Uncomment mentions of 'board' and 'neopixel' in python scripts
* Change 'spawn' commands
* Test running effects with "auto-write=True" and no "pixels.show()"
* Don't send 'effect' in communicator
* Remove frame limit

*** Coding ***
* Move where the settings are bound *** 
* Optimize effects...
* Meteor checkbox doesn't reflect effect's settings
* Optimize for mobile (!)
* Fire and Collisions effects
* Rainbow effect
* Meteor speed (slower by skipping frames, or faster by increasing distance of the newly drawn meteor)
* Saving configurations
* Do something if brightness control is >1
* Multiple effects!
* Inverted Fire effect

*** Alexa Integration ??? ***
* Figure out how to make Alexa make HTTP requests
* Create voice commands that correspond to that request

*** Audio Visualzing ***
* Copy over visualization stuff from Pi 4
* Get visualizer to work with Raspotify
* Get Raspotify and visualizer to work with bluetooth ðŸ¤¢
* Need long MicroUSB to 3.5mm audio cable (?)
* Setup Neopixel for the visualizer / Use their build in Pi controls
* Create new effect with 3 equilizer bars
* Get microphone?
* Possible issues: 
    * Will it work headless...? (github says maybe not)
    * Is the refresh rate going to be okay?
