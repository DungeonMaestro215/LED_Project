# Individually Addressable LED Project

This repository was made to hold of the programs that control the LEDs in my living room.

By communicating with my Raspberry Pi Zero via a browser-based GUI or directly through ssh, I am able to produce different patterns on my LED strip.


TODO:
* Make new gui
* Test running python scripts from Node backend
* Test running effects with "auto-write=True" and no "pixels.show()"
* Static effects
